## Description 
Projects include the following deliverables.

__(1) Demo__ students should produce a working demo of the system, share the project repository and deploy it on a website where the instructor and TA can access it. <br>

__(2) Video__ students should produce a 5-minute (or less) video of their demo and upload it to YouTube. <br>

__(3) Paper__ students should write a final paper about the project as if they were submitting it to a conference for publication. The papers should be written in the [LNCS format](http://www.springer.com/computer/lncs?SGWID=0-164-6-793341-0) and should be at most 5 pages long. The paper should be organized as a publication, stating the problem being addressed, the approach and description of the system, evaluation, related work and references. Using [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/) is encouraged.<br>

__(4) Presentation__ students will present their projects to the class using the [PechaKucha](http://www.pechakucha.org) presentation format. PechaKucha is a simple presentation format where you show 20 images, each for 20 seconds. The images advance automatically and you talk along to the images. You cannot use bullets in any of your slides. The presentation will be created with [Sozi](http://sozi.baierouge.fr).
